Community
=========

This is where we focus on and discuss our roll in the community.

Community is the primary focus of QCMerge. QCMerge is intended to be "of, by and for our tech community." QCMerge can only meet its goal by responding to the needs of the community but it cannot hope to achieve them without the active participation of the community.

Therefore the first priority is to get buy-in from the community in the form of [corporate sponsorships](https://github.com/qcmerge/community/issues/1).
